Game Instructions:
You have 100 hp, as shown in the top right, along with the rounds.
The round only starts once all turrets are placed.
Your turret count for each type of turret is also indicated on the right. Click the turret in that Pane to select it, then choose a spot on the map to place it down.
Once all turrets are placed, the enemies will start to follow the cyan path. The turrets will automatically target the futhest enemy, so play around this however you'd like.
You get a certain amount of turrets every round, and a new turret and ghost spawn every few rounds. Try to figure out when that happens!
Each turret and ghost have their own stats, currently still in the process of being balanced.
If a ghost reaches the end of the path, they will damage you, taking away some of your HP.
Your HP carries on from level to level.
Once all ghosts are killed or have attacked you, you will move on to the next level.
If you run out of health, a game over screen will be shown.
To play again, click R.

    CONSOLE APPLICATION : GameTest Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this GameTest application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your GameTest application.


GameTest.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

GameTest.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

GameTest.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named GameTest.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
